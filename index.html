         Its metropolitan area is the third-most populous within Italy. 
         Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber Valley. 
         Vatican City (the smallest country in the world and headquarters of the worldwide Catholic Church under the governance of the Holy See) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city. 
         Rome is often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its geographic location, and also as the "Eternal City". 
         Rome is generally considered to be the cradle of Western civilization and Western Christian culture, and the centre of the Catholic Church. </p>

    <p class="descript"><b>My Experience at Breaking Barriers Courses: Opportunities for Girls in Technology</b><br>
     In a world where technology plays an increasingly important role, initiatives like Breaking Barriers are essential for creating an inclusive and accessible environment for everyone. We had the opportunity to participate in these courses, and the experience was extraordinary, both educationally and inspirationally.
     <b>A Supportive and Growth-Oriented Community</b><br>
     Breaking Barriers is not just a technical training program but also a community where girls are encouraged to develop their skills and build confidence in their abilities. From the first session, we were welcomed by dedicated mentors who guided us with patience and professionalism. The friendly atmosphere and support from our peers helped us overcome our fears and focus on learning.
     <b>Technical Skills and Self-Confidence</b><br>
     An important aspect of the Breaking Barriers courses is that they focus not only on technical knowledge but also on personal development. We learned to work with different programming languages, develop practical projects, and collaborate in teams. Besides these technical skills, we discovered that self-confidence is just as important as any line of code written.
     <b>Why Is It Important to Support Girls in Technology?</b><br>
     The tech industry is still male-dominated, and this discrepancy can discourage many talented girls from pursuing a career in the field. Breaking Barriers has shown us how crucial female representation in technology is. When girls see successful role models and receive the necessary support, they are more motivated to follow their passions and contribute to innovation.
     <b>A Step Towards a More Equitable Future</b><br>
     My experience at Breaking Barriers demonstrated that change is possible. With more initiatives like this, gender barriers can be overcome, and the world of technology can become a more equitable place for everyone. Every girl who gets the chance to learn and grow in an inclusive environment can become an inspiration for future generations.
     We encourage all girls passionate about technology to follow their dreams and take advantage of the opportunities offered by programs like Breaking Barriers. The future belongs to those who dare to learn and innovate!
